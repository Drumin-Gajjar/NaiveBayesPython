# Naive Bayes
### By Drumin Gajjar
This project implements Naive Bayes algorithm in Python and it works on any data set with the following parameters - 
 - The name of the file that has the data should be named "input.csv". 
 - The dataset should have 5 columns in total. 
 - The first column should be the index column. 
 - There should be 3 predictor columns in between index and response column. 
 - The last column should be the response column. 
 - The testing data should be at the bottom, and should not contain any value in the response column. 
 
<p>The code shows Naive Bayes working in step by step form.  
The libraries used were pandas, numpy, csv and os.

Pandas and numpy was used to compute the data. 
CSV and OS were used to modify the csv file. </p>
